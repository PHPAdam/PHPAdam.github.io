![What is a Mortgage Calculator](https://hosker.info/images/multiple-bespoke-finance.jpg)


With my Mortgage Adviser father (Mark), we sat in the living room trying to come up with company names.

With several attempts behind us, Mark suggested "Bespoke Finance". Whilst checking Companies House, my response was "there is no way that is available."

I was wrong, and It was free! I set it up. 

Since 2009 for 11 years its been our name, Bespoke Finance.

# The Old Bespoke Finance

Unfortunately, we were not the first Bespoke Finance. A name too good not to be used before. A company with a simmular name dissolved just a few months before.

That means the name has a history. In 2010 got the first communication about a Payment Protection Insurance (PPI) complaint. We've never sold PPI.

Since then every month, we get threats from Solicitors and the odd county court case. They are all easily dismissed. Except after the first hundred, it gets annoying. 

The bothersome part was that our Company Credit File would get pinged now and then. That was more laborious to put right.

# The More Bespoke's the Merrier

Lenders started paying cash into the company bank account for no reason.

It turns out, Bespoke Finance is a name too good for just one company. Both Companies House and the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has approved many more.

31 companies set up using a variation of the name that we use. That we market and that we have been building trust and recognition with. (I've made a little list at the end of the article).

# The Issue

I read press articles of other Bespoke. I see people tagging the wrong Bespoke on Social Media. I receive money that was destined for them. I receive calls and emails from there clients. I compete on Google for my own brand. I hear radio adverts for a different Bespoke that friends think was us. With old website articles saying we missold Payment Protection Insurance (PPI) when we never offered it.

A brand is valuable to a company. If consumers can not differentiate your brand. You can lose potential clients by them calling the wrong company.

Incidentally, we get calls for Bespoke Joinery quite often. That is irrelevant they offer different services. The issue here is financial services firms with similar brand names.

# Stop using my name!

Companies House are very lax on companies using [similar names](https://www.qualitycompanyformations.co.uk/blog/can-company-name-another-company/).  It allows some use of a name variation, but some fall foul of The Company and Business Names (Miscellaneous Provisions) Regulations 2009.

Except we have just 1 year to realise a company has a similar name and object to Companies House.

Plus anyone can use a variation of the company name as a trading name, without consulting Companies House.

# What should I have done?

The way to adequately protect a brand is, therefore, a Trademark. A name at Companies House is no protection for your brand what so ever.

# The Future!

We are moving forward with a new name, [Cyborg Finance]. It's a new entity, a new [Trademark] and has all the domains we want. Including [.finance](https://cyborg.finance) and [.com](https://cyborgfinance.com) . 

No one is using it, its burdon free, its a brand we can build and prevent others from useing (this time arround).

We're not abandoning the [Bespoke Finance](https://bespokefinance.info) name. A new future still exists for it.

# What is a Mortgage Calculator?

Every day on Google 27,433 people search for "Mortgage Calculator". As the term is so vague, it has puzzled me. What are they trying to Calculate?


Is it Maximum Borrowing (Affordability) like [Virgin Money] provides. Otherwise, Monthly Mortgage Payment like [Citizens Advice] provides.

[Wikipedia] says:
> Mortgage calculators are used by consumers to determine monthly repayments

I'm not sure...


## Affordability Calculator

You use this calculator to find out the maximum mortgage achievable. You would typically provide the system with:

*   Monthly Income
*   Monthly Household Expenditure
*   Monthly Credit Commitments

Enter this into a simple formula to be provided with a maximum mortgage amount. It uses a persons income to estimate the maximum a bank would lend.

When searching "Mortgage Calculator," these companies have a tool which provides this function [Bank Rate], [Virgin Money] and [Principaliity].

![Mortgage Affordability Calculator](https://hosker.info/images/2-affordability-calculator.jpg)

> NOTE: These calculators are flawed instruments. They are mostly a rough guide, a budget with a multiplier. Not the Affordability Calculators Intermediaries Use.

## Mortgage Payment Calculator

You use this calculator to find out your monthly mortgage payments. You would typically provide the system with three things:

*   Mortgage Amount
*   Mortgage Term
*   Interest Rate

Enter this into the [PMT Function] to be provided with your monthly mortgage payment.

When searching "Mortgage Calculator," these companies provide this function [Confused], [LandC], [Knight Frank], [Alexander Hall], [Mortgages for Business], [Experian] and [Citizens Advice]

![Mortgage Payment Calculator](https://hosker.info/images/2-mortgage-payment-calculator.jpg)

> NOTE: These calculators are flawed instruments. Most do not have allowances for different types of rates, Introductory Rates and Standard Variable Rates (SVR).

## Mortgage Payment & Product Calculator

You use this calculator to find out your monthly mortgage payments **for each lender**. You would typically provide the system with three things:

*   Purchase Price
*   Mortgage Amount
*   Mortgage Term

Unlike the "Mortgage Payment Calculator," you do not enter an interest rate. Instead [Just Mortgages] puts the information into Mortgage Sourcing Software. It provides mortgage payments as calculated for several lenders products.

Other companies do the same but only for their mortgage range [Danske Bank], [Post Office], [Co-Operative Bank] and [Coutts].

## So, What are people trying to Calculate?

### It's not "Mortgage Payments"

Searching Google for "Mortgage Calculator" gives you mostly Mortgage Payment Calculators. Except there are few reasons, anyone would want this. Especially not 27,433 people a day. Consumers are always told the monthly payments on ESIS or KFI's. It would be rare to have on hand just the interest rate, mortgage amount and term without also having the mortgage payment.

By providing this calculator, I believe most companies are responding to consumer intent wrong.

It's reasonable for [Citizens Advice] to have it, so Consumers can confirm they are paying the correct amount. I can not see clients of lenders or mortgage brokers would needing it (more than the alternatives).

> NOTE: Nothing wrong in having this calculator. It's just not what people are looking for en-mass.

### It's maybe "Mortgage Payment & Product Calculator."

These are not "really" Calculators at all. Given the Mortgage Amount and the Loan-to-Value (LTV). The user is shown a simple mortgage comparison. Suppose a users intent was to compare mortgages. It would likely be a completely different search term such as "Compare Mortgages". Not "Mortgage Calculator".

Perhaps this may be the intent of a fraction of the 27,433 daily searches. Even if not, I imagine most will be happy with the results showing real mortgages available and what they would cost. However, it does nothing for eligibility on affordability.

### It's Probably "Mortgage Affordability Calculator"

The other option(s) seem a rare use case. It's more likely a person, at the start of there mortgage journey, wants to know how much they can borrow.

The data also shows this to be the case. Google Searches for "Mortgage Calculator" and "Mortgage Ability Calculator" is on par. They both receive 27,433 searches a day. I would suggest after searching "Mortgage Calculator" and not finding the desired results. People search "Mortgage Ability Calculator" instead.

## Tell me I'm wrong

My theory is that people searching Google for "Mortgage Calculator" are not getting what they want. The results are polluted with Mortgage Payment Calculators.

I may be wrong. I'm just applying logic and rough search data. Tell me on [LinkedIn] or [Twitter].
